This repository contains code for the ESWA Paper: [`Hierarchical Framework for Demand Prediction and Iterative Optimization of EV Charging Network Infrastructure Under Uncertainty with Cost and Quality-of-Service Consideration`](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423022637)

- The code for the experiments is found in the Jupyter Notebook `Analytics0011.ipynb` file in the folder `ESWA_Code_Submission`.
- The experiments use the CSV datasets in the folder.
- The code runs on `python 3.9`
- The required packages for running the code are in `requirements.txt`
- To setup the requirements, go to the folder with the file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the entire `notebook` by clicking on `Run All` to see the experiments output
